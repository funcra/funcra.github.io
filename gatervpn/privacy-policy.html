                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>GaterVPN ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard information when you use our mobile application (the "App").</p>
                <p><strong>Important Notice</strong>: GaterVPN is a client application only. We do not provide VPN servers. <strong>The security of VPN connections established through this App depends entirely on the VPN Gate servers you connect to, not on this client application.</strong> We cannot guarantee the security, privacy, or logging practices of VPN Gate servers. Please read the "VPN Connection Security" and "VPN Gate Disclaimer and Limitations" sections below for complete details.</p>

                <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
                
                <h3>Information We Do NOT Collect</h3>
                <p>We want to be transparent about what we do not collect:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>No Personal Information</strong>: We do not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information such as your name, email address, phone number, or physical address.</li>
                    <li><strong>No VPN Connection Logs (Client-Side)</strong>: As the client application developer, we do not log, monitor, or store your VPN connection activities, browsing history, or any data transmitted through the VPN connection. However, please note that VPN Gate servers (which we do not control) may maintain their own logs. The security and logging practices of VPN Gate servers are entirely controlled by VPN Gate and individual server providers, not by this App.</li>
                    <li><strong>No Location Data</strong>: We do not collect or track your location information.</li>
                    <li><strong>No User Content (Client-Side)</strong>: As the client application, we do not access, collect, or store any content you access through the VPN connection. All VPN traffic is handled directly between your device and the VPN Gate server. We have no visibility into or control over the data transmitted through VPN connections.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Information We Collect</h3>

                </ul>

                <h4>2. Advertising Data (Google AdMob)</h4>
                <p>Our App uses Google AdMob to display advertisements in the free version. AdMob may collect and use the following information:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Advertising ID</strong>: AdMob may collect your device's advertising identifier (IDFA) to serve personalized ads.</li>
                    <li><strong>Device Information</strong>: AdMob may collect device information such as device type, operating system version, and language settings.</li>
                    <li><strong>Usage Data</strong>: AdMob may collect information about how you interact with advertisements.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>For more information about how Google uses data, please visit: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google's Privacy Policy</a></p>
                <p>You can opt out of personalized advertising by adjusting your device's advertising settings:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>iOS: Settings > Privacy & Security > Apple Advertising > Personalized Ads</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>3. In-App Purchase Data</h4>
                <p>When you make an in-app purchase, the transaction is processed entirely by Apple through the App Store. We do not have access to your payment information. Apple may collect and process payment information according to their privacy policy.</p>

                <h2>How We Use Information</h2>

                <ul>

                    <li><strong>VPN Gate Services</strong>: When you connect to a VPN server, your connection is established directly between your device and the VPN Gate server. As the client application developer, we do not intercept, monitor, or log any data transmitted through the VPN connection. However, the security, privacy practices, and potential logging of VPN Gate servers are entirely controlled by VPN Gate and individual server providers, not by this App.</li>
                    <li><strong>App Store</strong>: In-app purchases are processed by Apple. We do not have access to your payment information.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
                <p>We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties. However, we use the following third-party services that may collect information:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Google AdMob</strong>: For advertising services. See <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google's Privacy Policy</a> for details.</li>
                    <li><strong>Apple App Store</strong>: For in-app purchase processing. See <a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple's Privacy Policy</a> for details.</li>

                <h3>Client-Side Security</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>All data stored locally on your device is protected by iOS security features.</li>

                <h3>VPN Connection Security</h3>
                <p><strong>Important</strong>: GaterVPN is a client application only. We do not provide VPN servers. The security of your VPN connections depends entirely on:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>VPN Gate Servers</strong>: VPN connections are established directly with VPN Gate servers, which are provided by volunteers worldwide. The security, encryption, and privacy practices of these servers are controlled by VPN Gate and individual server operators, not by this App.</li>
                    <li><strong>OpenVPN Protocol</strong>: While VPN connections use the OpenVPN protocol for encryption, the actual security implementation depends on the VPN Gate server configuration, which we do not control.</li>
                    <li><strong>Server Logging</strong>: VPN Gate servers may maintain their own connection logs. We have no control over or visibility into what VPN Gate servers log or how they handle your data.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>We cannot guarantee the security or privacy of VPN Gate servers.</strong> By using this App, you acknowledge that VPN communication security depends on VPN Gate servers, not on this client application.</p>

                <p>Our App is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us immediately.</p>

                    <li><strong>Premium Version</strong>: You can purchase the premium version to remove all advertisements.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Data Retention</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Local Data</strong>: All data stored locally on your device remains on your device until you delete it or uninstall the App.</li>

                    <li><strong>No Server-Side Data</strong>: We do not maintain any servers that store your data.</li>
                </ul>
